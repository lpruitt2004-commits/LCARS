  title: "Deflector Shield",
  short: "Protective energy field used by starships.",
  long: `Deflector shields are advanced energy fields used by starships and space stations in the Star Trek universe to protect against physical and energy-based threats. Shields are a critical component of starship defense systems.

Technology:
Deflector shields work by generating a force field around the vessel, capable of absorbing or deflecting incoming energy blasts, projectiles, and debris. The shield's strength is determined by the ship's power output and shield generator technology.

Uses:
- Defense against phasers, disruptors, and torpedoes
- Protection from space debris, radiation, and environmental hazards
- Modulation to counteract specific threats (e.g., frequency adaptation)

History:
Shields evolved from earlier navigational deflectors, which protected ships from micrometeoroids. Modern shields are standard on all Federation and many alien vessels.

Major Appearances:
- "The Original Series" – Early use of shields in combat
- "The Next Generation" – Advanced shield modulation and tactics
- "Deep Space Nine" and "Voyager" – Shields used in large-scale battles

Legacy:
Deflector shields are a staple of science fiction, representing technological ingenuity and the ongoing arms race between offense and defense in space warfare.
