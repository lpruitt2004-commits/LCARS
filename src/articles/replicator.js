  title: "Replicator",
  short: "Device that creates objects and food from energy.",
  long: `The replicator is a technological marvel in the Star Trek universe, capable of creating objects, food, and tools by rearranging subatomic particles and converting energy into matter. Replicators are standard equipment on Federation starships and space stations.

Technology:
Replicators use matter-energy conversion, based on transporter technology, to assemble items at the molecular level. Patterns for objects are stored in a database and can be selected via voice or touch interface.

Uses:
- Food and drink: Replicators provide meals and beverages on demand, eliminating the need for traditional kitchens.
- Tools and spare parts: Starfleet engineers use replicators to fabricate components and repair equipment.
- Clothing and personal items: Crew members can replicate uniforms and accessories.

Limitations:
Replicated food is sometimes considered inferior to freshly prepared meals. Replicators cannot create complex living organisms or certain rare materials (e.g., latinum). Energy and pattern storage constraints also apply.

Major Appearances:
- "The Next Generation" – Replicators become standard on starships
- "Deep Space Nine" – Replicators used in civilian and commercial settings
- "Voyager" – Replicator rationing due to limited resources

Legacy:
The replicator represents the post-scarcity ideals of Star Trek, inspiring real-world research into 3D printing and molecular assembly technologies.
