  title: "Transporter",
  short: "Device that teleports people and objects instantly.",
  long: `The transporter is a revolutionary device in the Star Trek universe that enables near-instantaneous travel by converting matter into energy, transmitting it to a target location, and reassembling it back into matter. It is a standard feature on Federation starships, space stations, and many alien vessels.

Technology:
The transporter works by scanning and dematerializing a person or object into an energy pattern, transmitting that pattern through subspace, and rematerializing it at the destination. The process involves:
- Molecular pattern buffer: Stores the scanned pattern during transport
- Annular confinement beam: Maintains the integrity of the pattern
- Heisenberg compensators: Overcome quantum uncertainty for precise reassembly

Uses:
- Personnel transport: Moving crew members between ship and planet, or within a vessel
- Cargo transport: Transferring supplies, equipment, and hazardous materials
- Emergency evacuation: Rapid rescue from dangerous situations

Risks and Limitations:
Transporters are subject to interference from energy fields, atmospheric conditions, and shield technology. Malfunctions can result in accidents, duplication, or loss of pattern integrity. Some species and individuals are wary of transporters due to philosophical or medical concerns.

Major Appearances:
- "The Original Series" – Iconic transporter effect and catchphrase "Beam me up, Scotty"
- "The Next Generation" – Advanced transporter technology and ethical dilemmas
- "Deep Space Nine" and "Voyager" – Use in tactical and emergency scenarios

Legacy:
The transporter is one of Star Trek's most recognizable inventions, symbolizing the franchise's imaginative approach to technology. It has inspired real-world research into quantum teleportation and instant travel concepts.
