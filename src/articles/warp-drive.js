  title: "Warp Drive",
  short: "Faster-than-light propulsion in the Star Trek universe.",
  long: `Warp drive is the primary method of faster-than-light travel in the Star Trek universe, allowing starships to traverse vast interstellar distances by warping space-time. The technology is based on the creation of a warp field using matter-antimatter reactions regulated by dilithium crystals, which bends space around the vessel and enables superluminal speeds.

Technology:
Warp drive works by generating a subspace field that distorts the fabric of space, creating a "warp bubble" around the ship. This bubble allows the vessel to move at multiples of the speed of light, measured in "warp factors." The original warp scale (TOS) was linear, but later series (TNG, DS9, Voyager) use a logarithmic scale where warp 10 is infinite speed.

Key Components:
- Matter-antimatter reactor: Provides the immense energy required for warp travel.
- Dilithium crystals: Regulate the reaction and stabilize the warp field.
- Warp coils: Located in the nacelles, generate the warp field.

History:
The first human starship to achieve warp drive was the Phoenix, built by Zefram Cochrane in 2063 (Star Trek: First Contact). Warp technology enabled the formation of the United Federation of Planets and is a prerequisite for first contact with other civilizations.

Major Appearances:
- "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (TOS) – Early warp travel
- "Star Trek: First Contact" (film) – Invention of warp drive
- "Threshold" (Voyager) – Exploration of warp 10

Limitations and Ethics:
Warp travel can damage subspace, leading to restrictions on high-warp travel (TNG: "Force of Nature"). The technology is central to Star Trek's vision of exploration and cooperation.

Legacy:
Warp drive is one of the most iconic concepts in science fiction, inspiring real-world scientific discussions about faster-than-light travel and space exploration.
