  title: "Prime Directive",
  short: "Starfleet's rule of non-interference with alien civilizations.",
  long: `The Prime Directive, also known as Starfleet General Order 1, is the fundamental guiding principle of Starfleet and the United Federation of Planets in the Star Trek universe. It mandates strict non-interference with the natural development of alien civilizations, especially those that have not achieved faster-than-light (warp) travel.

Philosophy:
The Prime Directive embodies the ethical commitment to respect the autonomy and cultural evolution of other societies. It is designed to prevent Starfleet personnel from influencing, exploiting, or altering the course of civilizations, regardless of intentions or perceived benefits.

Applications:
- Prohibits providing advanced technology or knowledge to pre-warp societies
- Forbids intervention in internal affairs, wars, or crises, even to prevent suffering
- Applies to all Starfleet officers and missions, with rare exceptions for extreme circumstances

Controversies:
The Prime Directive is often a source of moral dilemmas, as strict adherence can result in tragic outcomes. Captains and crews have debated its interpretation, sometimes choosing to violate it for humanitarian reasons or under extraordinary threats.

Major Appearances:
- "The Original Series" – Frequent exploration of the directive's limits
- "The Next Generation" – Picard's philosophical debates and difficult decisions
- "Deep Space Nine" and "Voyager" – Complex scenarios involving non-Federation worlds

Legacy:
The Prime Directive is one of science fiction's most famous ethical concepts, sparking real-world discussions about intervention, colonialism, and cultural respect. It remains central to Star Trek's vision of responsible exploration and diplomacy.
