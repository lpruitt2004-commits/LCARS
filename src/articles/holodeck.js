  title: "Holodeck",
  short: "Simulated reality facility for training and recreation.",
  long: `The holodeck is an advanced simulated reality environment featured in the Star Trek universe, primarily aboard Federation starships and space stations. It uses holographic technology, force fields, and matter replication to create fully immersive, interactive scenarios for training, recreation, and entertainment.

Technology:
The holodeck combines holographic projections, force fields, and replicated matter to simulate any environment or character. Users can interact physically with objects and people within the simulation, and the system can respond dynamically to voice commands and actions.

Uses:
- Training: Starfleet personnel use holodecks for tactical simulations, emergency drills, and skill development.
- Recreation: Crew members enjoy leisure activities, games, and storytelling adventures.
- Therapy: Holodecks provide psychological support and counseling through simulated environments.

History:
First introduced in "Star Trek: The Animated Series" as the "recreation room," the holodeck became a staple in "The Next Generation" and subsequent series. The technology is continually refined, with safety protocols to prevent harm to users.

Major Appearances:
- "The Big Goodbye" (TNG) – First major holodeck episode
- "Elementary, Dear Data" (TNG) – Sentient holodeck character
- "Our Man Bashir" (DS9) – Holosuite adventure
- "Bride of Chaotica!" (Voyager) – Holodeck malfunction

Legacy:
The holodeck represents the ultimate in virtual reality, inspiring real-world research into immersive environments and interactive storytelling. It is a symbol of Star Trek's optimistic vision of technology enhancing life and creativity.
